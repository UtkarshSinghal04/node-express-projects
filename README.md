# Node.js & Express.js Projects

I have completed these mini projects to learn **Node.js** and **Express.js**, focusing mainly on the backend. These projects helped me understand RESTful APIs, user authentication, and interacting with MongoDB. Although I haven’t implemented the frontend yet, the backend logic covers data handling, authentication using JWT, and error handling, which laid a solid foundation for building robust applications.

## 1. Task Manager API
A fully-featured task management system built using Node.js and Express. This project covers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for task management, with added features like user authentication using JWT tokens, input validation, and error handling. Users can register, log in, and create personalized task lists, update task statuses, and delete tasks. Data is stored in MongoDB, making it scalable for real-world applications.

## 2. Store API
A dynamic API to handle product listings for an e-commerce platform. This project allows users to fetch, filter, sort, and paginate product data efficiently. Key features include flexible search queries, price-based filtering, and sorting options. The application interacts with a MongoDB database, handling large datasets and providing smooth search functionality using Mongoose, making it perfect for learning about handling product inventories.

## 4. Jobs API
An API designed for managing job listings and applications. The project features user authentication, role-based access control (admin/user), and CRUD functionality for job postings. Users can create, update, and delete job listings, and admins have additional capabilities. The API connects to a MongoDB database and offers search filters based on job titles, companies, and job types. It’s an excellent demonstration of real-world API development with an organized data flow.
